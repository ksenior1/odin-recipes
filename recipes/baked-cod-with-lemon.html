        <h2>How to make step by step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place softened butter, minced garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme or rosemary on a cutting board. 
                Using a sharp knife, cut herbs and garlic into each other and the butter, cutting and mixing as you go. 
                Add pink salt, black pepper, and paprika, and mix until well blended.</li>
            <li>Pat cod filets dry. In a 12x18-inch casserole or baking pan, place each filet on top of 2 lemon slices. 
                Evenly divide herb butter mixture among the filets; use a fork or offset spatula to spread herb butter over filets. 
                Top each filet with 2 remaining lemon slices.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cod flakes easily with a fork, 13 to 15 minutes. See note.</li>
            <li>To serve, drizzle each filet with extra virgin olive oil, and garnish with fresh parsley, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
