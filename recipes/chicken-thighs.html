        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> 
            These easy baked chicken thighs require minimum preparation; I love this quick recipe because I'm a college student! 
            Feel free to season the chicken with your favorite spices. I like to use cayenne powder and black pepper.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons onion flakes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to make baked chicken thighs step-by-step</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Place chicken thighs in a baking dish; season both sides with garlic powder and onion flakes.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 30 minutes. 
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
